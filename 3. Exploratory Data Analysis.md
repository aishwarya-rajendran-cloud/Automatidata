**Course 3 - Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights**

You are the newest data professional in a fictional data consulting firm: Automatidata. 
The team is still early into the project, having only just completed an initial plan of action and some early Python coding work. 

Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. 
For this taxi data, create a Tableau dashboard showing a New York City map of taxi/limo trips by month.

and remember that the assistant director at the New York City TLC is a person with visual impairments.
